# Peace Lily

Spathiphyllum is a genus of about 47 species of monocotyledonous flowering plants in the family Araceae,
native to tropical regions of the Americas and southeastern Asia. Certain species of Spathiphyllum are commonly known as spath
or peace lilies.

They are evergreen herbaceous perennial plants with large leaves 12–65 cm long and 3–25 cm broad. The flowers are produced in a
spadix, surrounded by a 10–30 cm long, white, yellowish, or greenish spathe. The plant does not need large amounts of light or
water to survive. They are most often grown as houseplants, however they are able to withstand the elements well enough to thrive
when planted outdoors in situations that are hot and humid.

## Watering requirements

Peace lilies need consistently moist soil, but they definitely don't like to sit in standing water.
Whenever the top inch of soil is dry, water the plant until the overflow starts to come out of the bottom of the container.
Wait until it stops draining, then set the pot back in its saucer.
